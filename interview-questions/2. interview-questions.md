# JavaScript Interview Questions Guide

This document covers common interview questions on core JavaScript concepts. Each question is followed by a detailed answer to help you understand the fundamental concepts better.

## 1. What's the difference between `map`, `forEach`, and `filter`?

- **`map()`**: 
  - Creates a new array populated with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array.
  - It **returns a new array** with transformed elements.
  - Example:
    ```javascript
    const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
    const squared = numbers.map(num => num * 2); // [2, 4, 6]
    ```

- **`forEach()`**: 
  - Executes a provided function once for each array element.
  - It **does not return** a new array; it simply iterates over the array.
  - Example:
    ```javascript
    const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
    numbers.forEach(num => console.log(num)); // 1 2 3
    ```

- **`filter()`**: 
  - Creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function.
  - It **returns a new array** with filtered elements.
  - Example:
    ```javascript
    const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
    const evens = numbers.filter(num => num % 2 === 0); // [2]
    ```

## 2. What's the difference between `filter` and `find`?

- **`filter()`**:
  - Returns a new array containing all the elements that pass the test provided by the function.
  - It returns all matching elements.
  - Example:
    ```javascript
    const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
    const evens = numbers.filter(num => num % 2 === 0); // [2, 4]
    ```

- **`find()`**:
  - Returns the **first element** in the array that satisfies the provided testing function.
  - It returns only one element (the first match).
  - Example:
    ```javascript
    const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
    const firstEven = numbers.find(num => num % 2 === 0); // 2
    ```

## 3. What is the difference between `for...of` and `for...in`?

- **`for...of`**:
  - Iterates over **iterable** objects (like arrays, strings, maps, etc.).
  - It gives the value of each element.
  - Example:
    ```javascript
    const array = [10, 20, 30];
    for (const value of array) {
      console.log(value); // 10, 20, 30
    }
    ```

- **`for...in`**:
  - Iterates over **enumerable properties** of an object (including the array's index).
  - It gives the key (or index for arrays) of each property.
  - Example:
    ```javascript
    const array = [10, 20, 30];
    for (const key in array) {
      console.log(key); // 0, 1, 2
    }
    ```

## 4. How do you empty an array?

You can empty an array in several ways:

- **Setting length to 0**:
  ```javascript
  let arr = [1, 2, 3];
  arr.length = 0;
  console.log(arr); // []
  ```

- **Reassigning to a new empty array**:
  ```javascript
  let arr = [1, 2, 3];
  arr = [];
  console.log(arr); // []
  ```

- **Using `splice()`**:
  ```javascript
  let arr = [1, 2, 3];
  arr.splice(0, arr.length);
  console.log(arr); // []
  ```

## 5. Difference between class and object.

- **Class**:
  - A blueprint for creating objects with predefined properties and methods.
  - Defines the structure and behavior that the created objects will have.
  - Example:
    ```javascript
    class Person {
      constructor(name) {
        this.name = name;
      }

      greet() {
        console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}`);
      }
    }
    ```

- **Object**:
  - An instance of a class containing actual values instead of placeholders.
  - Represents an individual entity with properties and behavior defined by its class.
  - Example:
    ```javascript
    const person1 = new Person('John');
    person1.greet(); // Hello, my name is John
    ```

## 6. What is a Prototype chain? How does inheritance work in JavaScript?

- **Prototype Chain**:
  - A mechanism in JavaScript where objects inherit properties and methods from other objects.
  - If a property or method is not found on an object, JavaScript looks for it in the object's prototype, and so on up the chain.

- **Inheritance**:
  - Objects inherit properties and methods from their prototype, which is defined by their constructor function or class.
  - Example:
    ```javascript
    function Animal(name) {
      this.name = name;
    }

    Animal.prototype.eat = function() {
      console.log(`${this.name} is eating`);
    };

    const dog = new Animal('Dog');
    dog.eat(); // Dog is eating
    ```

## 7. What does destructuring do in ES6?

- **Destructuring**:
  - A syntax that allows you to unpack values from arrays or properties from objects into distinct variables.
  - Simplifies extracting values from complex objects or arrays.
  - Example:
    ```javascript
    // Array Destructuring
    const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
    const [first, second] = numbers; // first = 1, second = 2

    // Object Destructuring
    const person = { name: 'John', age: 30 };
    const { name, age } = person; // name = 'John', age = 30
    ```

## 8. Is optional chaining the same as the ternary operator?

- **Optional Chaining (`?.`)**:
  - Allows you to safely access nested object properties without having to explicitly check if each reference in the chain is `null` or `undefined`.
  - Example:
    ```javascript
    const user = { address: { city: 'New York' } };
    console.log(user?.address?.city); // 'New York'
    console.log(user?.contact?.email); // undefined
    ```

- **Ternary Operator (`?:`)**:
  - A shorthand for the `if` statement that returns one value if the condition is true and another if it is false.
  - Example:
    ```javascript
    const age = 18;
    const canVote = age >= 18 ? 'Yes' : 'No'; // 'Yes'
    ```

## 9. What do you mean by dot notation and bracket notation? When should you use dot notation or bracket notation?

- **Dot Notation**:
  - Used to access object properties when you know the exact name of the property.
  - Example:
    ```javascript
    const person = { name: 'John' };
    console.log(person.name); // 'John'
    ```

- **Bracket Notation**:
  - Used to access object properties with variable keys or keys with special characters or spaces.
  - Example:
    ```javascript
    const person = { 'first-name': 'John' };
    console.log(person['first-name']); // 'John'

    const key = 'name';
    console.log(person[key]); // 'John'
    ```

- **When to use**:
  - Use dot notation when the property name is a valid identifier and is known beforehand.
  - Use bracket notation when the property name is dynamic or not a valid identifier.
